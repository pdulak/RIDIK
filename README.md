Hey there! Just wanted to let you know that I'm not really a JS developer, so I'm not exactly an expert when it comes to Electron either. So if you do decide to use it, please keep that in mind and use at your own risk! 

## Installation
1. `npm i`
2. copy `config-sample.json` to `config.json` and fill with proper keys
3. `npm start`
